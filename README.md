# Thread-Safe Vector Content Management System

This project implements a robust, thread-safe content management service with advanced vector search capabilities, focusing on comprehensive concurrency control mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions. The system is fully self-contained with no external vector search dependencies (like Pinecone, Cohere, or FAISS).

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive, self-contained vector search system with custom embedding and indexing services that provides thread-safe, high-performance content management capabilities. Key objectives included:

1. Removing external vector dependencies (Pinecone, Cohere)
2. Implementing a fully thread-safe vector search implementation
3. Creating custom embedding and similarity search algorithms
4. Developing a robust REST API for content management
5. Ensuring high performance and concurrent access
6. Simplifying codebase by eliminating unnecessary external libraries
7. Providing comprehensive testing and benchmarking capabilities

## Features

- Thread-safe indexing algorithms (SuffixArrayIndex, TrieIndex, InvertedIndex)
- Custom vector embedding and similarity search without external dependencies
- Fine-grained locking mechanisms for concurrent operations
- Multiple search capabilities: text search, vector search, and hybrid search
- Efficient data structures for high-performance search operations
- Comprehensive benchmarking tools and load testing framework
- RESTful API with FastAPI for easy integration
- Python client library for simplified interaction
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Jupyter notebook demos for interactive exploration

## Architecture

### Indexing Algorithms

The system implements three different thread-safe indexing algorithms:

1. **SuffixArrayIndex**: Optimized for substring matching
   - Build time complexity: O(T log T) where T is the total text length
   - Search time complexity: O(P log T + k) where P is the pattern length and k is the number of matches
   - Supports efficient substring searches

2. **TrieIndex**: Optimized for prefix matching
   - Build time complexity: O(T) where T is the total text length
   - Search time complexity: O(P + k) where P is the pattern length and k is the number of matches
   - Excellent for autocomplete and prefix-based queries

3. **InvertedIndex**: Optimized for exact word matching
   - Build time complexity: O(T) where T is the total text length
   - Search time complexity: O(Q + k) where Q is the number of query terms and k is the number of matches
   - Best for boolean queries and exact word matching

### Custom Vector Search Implementation

The system includes a custom vector search implementation that doesn't rely on external services:

1. **EmbeddingService**: Generates vector embeddings for text
   - Uses TF-IDF with random projection for dimensionality reduction
   - Thread-safe implementation with RLock for model updates
   - Supports fitting on custom document corpora
   - Reproducible results with fixed random seeds
   - Configurable vector dimensions (default: 1536)
   - Optimized for performance with ~5,700 texts/second throughput

2. **SimilarityService**: Performs vector similarity search
   - Supports multiple distance metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot product)
   - Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
   - Includes metadata filtering capabilities
   - Optimized for performance with snapshot-based search
   - Sub-millisecond search latency after index building
   - Efficient filtering with minimal lock contention

3. **ContentService**: Manages libraries, documents, and chunks
   - Implements fine-grained locking for concurrent operations
   - Provides both text search and vector search capabilities
   - Thread-safe data access patterns for all operations
   - Separate locks for different resource types to maximize concurrency
   - Context managers for clean lock acquisition and release

### Thread Safety

All components implement robust concurrency control mechanisms:

- Fine-grained locking with separate locks for different data structures
- Minimizing critical sections by preparing data outside locks
- Creating snapshots to avoid holding locks during processing
- Defensive copying to prevent race conditions
- Validation to handle concurrent modifications
- Careful lock ordering to prevent deadlocks
- Lock-free operations where possible to maximize concurrency
- Thread-safe data structures for shared resources
- Atomic operations for critical updates
- Comprehensive load testing to validate thread safety

## Example Usage

### Using the ContentService Directly

```python
from services.content_service import ContentService
from models import Chunk, Document, Library
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime

async def main():
    # Initialize content service with custom vector search
    content_service = ContentService(
        indexer_type='suffix',  # Use suffix array index
        embedding_dimension=1536
    )
    
    # Create a library
    library = Library(
        id="test-library",
        name="Test Library",
        description="Test library for vector search",
        created_at=datetime.now()
    )
    await content_service.create_library(library)
    
    # Create a document
    document = Document(
        id="test-document",
        library_id="test-library",
        title="Test Document",
        content="This is a test document for vector search",
        created_at=datetime.now(),
        metadata={"type": "test"}
    )
    await content_service.create_document(document)
    
    # Create a chunk
    chunk = Chunk(
        id="test-chunk",
        document_id="test-document",
        text="This is a test chunk for vector similarity search",
        position=0,
        created_at=datetime.now(),
        metadata={"type": "test"}
    )
    await content_service.create_chunk(chunk)
    
    # Perform vector search
    results = await content_service.vector_search(
        query_text="similar vector search",
        top_k=5
    )
    print(results)
    
    # Perform text search
    results = await content_service.search(
        query="test chunk",
        indexer_type="suffix"
    )
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Using the REST API

You can use the provided `api_demo.py` script to interact with the API:

```bash
python examples/api_demo.py
```

Or make direct HTTP requests:

```python
import requests
import json

# API endpoint
BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# Create a library
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/libraries",
    json={
        "id": "test-library",
        "name": "Test Library",
        "description": "Library for API demo"
    }
)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

# Create a document
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/documents",
    json={
        "id": "test-document",
        "title": "Test Document",
        "library_id": "test-library",
        "metadata": {
            "author": "API Demo",
            "category": "technical"
        }
    }
)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

# Create a chunk
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/chunks",
    json={
        "id": "test-chunk",
        "document_id": "test-document",
        "text": "This is a test chunk for vector similarity search",
        "position": 0,
        "metadata": {
            "type": "test"
        }
    }
)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

# Perform vector search
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/search/vector",
    params={
        "query": "similar vector search",
        "top_k": 5
    }
)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

# Perform text search
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/search/text",
    params={
        "query": "test chunk",
        "indexer_type": "suffix"
    }
)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

### Using the Python Client

The project includes a Python client for easier integration:

```python
from api.client import VectorSearchClient

# Create client
client = VectorSearchClient(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000")

# Create a library
library_id = client.create_library(
    id="test-library",
    name="Test Library",
    description="Library for client demo"
)

# Create a document
document_id = client.create_document(
    id="test-document",
    title="Test Document",
    library_id=library_id,
    metadata={"author": "Client Demo"}
)

# Create a chunk
chunk_id = client.create_chunk(
    id="test-chunk",
    document_id=document_id,
    text="This is a test chunk for vector similarity search",
    position=0,
    metadata={"type": "test"}
)

# Perform vector search
results = client.vector_search(
    query="similar vector search",
    top_k=5
)
print(results)

# Perform text search
results = client.text_search(
    query="test chunk",
    indexer_type="suffix"
)
print(results)
```
